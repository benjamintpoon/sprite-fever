Make pixel art, and watch it dance!

Just `git clone` the repo, `bundle install`, and run `ruby app.rb`. You should be all set to boogie on `localhost:4567`! :dance:

Note: If you run into an issue with requiring the `firebase` gem, navigate to your gem folder (`gem environment` to see installation paths), and change the permissions on the `firebase` directory, for me the command was `sudo chmod -R 775 /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/firebase-0.2.2`
